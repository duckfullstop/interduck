ðŸ‘‹ Hi, and welcome to the fourth major iteration of my landing page - this time, it's got a blog!

## interduck.
The new site is called _interduck._ (the old one was "_duckdotweb_") Whereas previous iterations were dynamically generated on the fly (using frameworks like _Laravel_), _interduck._ is entirely statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for some super speedy page loads. If you're morbidly curious, the source is available at [github/duckfullstop/interduck](https://github.com/duckfullstop/interduck).

I don't really need anything fancy here that would need dynamic generation anymore, so this feels like the obvious step to keep things simple.



## This blog
It's very rare for me to use long-form text like this for public facing stuff, but there's been one or two occasions that I've wanted a space like this to throw some thoughts down. Ergo, here it is!

I'm really not sure how often it'll get used (hell, don't be surprised if this is the only post here as you read), but keep your eyes peeled. I'll announce anything noteworthy on my [Mastodon](https://queer.af/@duck).
